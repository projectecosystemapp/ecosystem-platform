## üìã Migration Instructions

npm run db:migrate
```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
```env
# Add to .env.local
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret_here
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url (optional)
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your_api_key (for production)
```

3. **Set up cron job for reconciliation:**
```bash
# Vercel cron (vercel.json)
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/reconciliation",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. **Initialize tax rates:**
```typescript
// Example: Add US sales tax
await taxService.upsertTaxRate({
  country: 'US',
  state: 'CA',
  taxType: 'sales_tax',
  rate: 0.0875, // 8.75%
  appliesTo: ['service'],
  effectiveDate: new Date(),
  isActive: true
});

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**: All implementations follow PCI DSS requirements
2. **Idempotency**: All payment operations use idempotency keys
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for financial operations
4. **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
5. **Rate Limiting**: Applied to all public endpoints
6. **Webhook Validation**: Stripe signature verification on all webhooks
