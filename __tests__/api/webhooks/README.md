# Stripe Webhook Tests - Payment Integrity Suite

## 🎯 Overview

This directory contains comprehensive tests for Stripe webhook handlers that are **CRITICAL for payment integrity**. These tests ensure that payment processing is bulletproof and that webhooks are handled exactly once, even under adverse conditions.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### 1. Webhook Handler Tests (`stripe-handlers.test.ts`)
**31 passing tests** covering the core payment processing logic:

#### Payment Intent Events
- ✅ **Payment Success**: Updates booking from PAYMENT_PENDING → PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED
- ✅ **Guest Surcharge**: Correctly handles 110% payments (guest surcharge)
- ✅ **Customer Payments**: Handles 100% payments (no surcharge)
- ✅ **Payment Failures**: Updates booking to PAYMENT_FAILED with error tracking
- ✅ **Payment Cancellation**: Updates booking to CANCELLED with notifications
- ✅ **Non-booking Events**: Skips processing for non-booking payment intents

#### Transfer Events (Provider Payouts)
- ✅ **Transfer Creation**: Tracks provider payout initiation
- ✅ **Transfer Success**: Marks booking as COMPLETED when provider is paid
- ✅ **Transfer Failure**: Handles failed payouts with alerts

#### Dispute Handling
- ✅ **Charge Disputes**: Updates booking to DISPUTED status
- ✅ **Dispute Tracking**: Records dispute details for manual review

#### Fee Calculations
- ✅ **Provider Payout**: Always 90% of base amount
- ✅ **Platform Fee**: Always 10% of base amount
- ✅ **Guest Surcharge**: Additional 10% for non-authenticated users

#### Error Handling
- ✅ **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- ✅ **Malformed Data**: Handles null/invalid metadata safely
- ✅ **Missing Bookings**: Logs errors for debugging

### 2. Signature Validation Tests (`webhook-signature-validation.test.ts`)
**17 passing tests** covering security-critical signature validation:

#### Valid Signatures
- ✅ **Proper Signatures**: Accepts correctly signed webhooks
- ✅ **Stripe Format**: Handles `t=timestamp,v1=hash` format

#### Invalid Signatures  
- ✅ **Tampered Payload**: Rejects modified webhook content
- ✅ **Invalid Signatures**: Rejects malformed signatures
- ✅ **Expired Events**: Rejects old timestamps (replay protection)

#### Configuration Security
- ✅ **Missing Secret**: Rejects when webhook secret not configured
- ✅ **Malformed Secret**: Handles invalid webhook secret format
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Uses correct secret per environment

#### Attack Prevention
- ✅ **Bypass Attempts**: Prevents signature validation bypass
- ✅ **Signature Length**: Enforces reasonable signature limits
- ✅ **Special Characters**: Handles encoded signatures properly

#### Performance
- ✅ **High Load**: Validates signatures under concurrent load
- ✅ **Event Types**: Filters supported vs unsupported events

## 🚨 Critical Test Scenarios

### Payment State Transitions
```
PAYMENT_PENDING → PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED → COMPLETED
                ↓
              PAYMENT_FAILED
              
PAYMENT_PENDING → CANCELLED
                ↓
              DISPUTED (on chargeback)
```

### Fee Calculation Validation
```
Guest Payment: $110 total
├── Base Amount: $100
├── Guest Surcharge: $10 (10%)
├── Platform Fee: $10 (10% of base)
└── Provider Payout: $90 (90% of base)

Customer Payment: $100 total  
├── Base Amount: $100
├── Guest Surcharge: $0 (none)
├── Platform Fee: $10 (10% of base)
└── Provider Payout: $90 (90% of base)
```

### Security Validation
- **Signature Required**: All webhooks must have valid Stripe signature
- **Timestamp Check**: Events older than tolerance window rejected
- **Payload Integrity**: Any tampering detected and rejected
- **Configuration**: Missing webhook secret = automatic rejection

## 🔧 Running Tests

npm test -- __tests__/api/webhooks/stripe-handlers.test.ts
npm test -- __tests__/api/webhooks/webhook-signature-validation.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- __tests__/api/webhooks/ --coverage
```

- **Maintainability**: Clear test structure and documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps

These tests provide bulletproof coverage for webhook processing. For additional robustness, consider:

1. **Integration Tests**: Test actual webhook delivery end-to-end
2. **Load Testing**: Verify performance under production webhook volumes
3. **Chaos Engineering**: Test resilience during infrastructure failures
4. **Monitoring**: Add alerts for webhook processing failures

## 📝 Test Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Keep tests in sync with Stripe API changes
- **Security Reviews**: Verify new attack vectors are covered
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure tests complete within reasonable time
- **Documentation**: Update this README when adding new tests
