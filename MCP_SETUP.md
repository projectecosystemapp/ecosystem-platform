# MCP Server Setup - Status Report

## ✅ Successfully Installed MCP Servers

### Working Servers:
1. **seq-thinking** ✓ Connected - Sequential thinking for structured reasoning
2. **filesystem** ✓ Connected - File operations for project context  
3. **memory** ✓ Connected - In-session context recall

### Servers Needing Attention:
4. **git** ✗ Failed to connect - May need different configuration
5. **fetch** ✗ Failed to connect - May need different configuration
6. **time** ✗ Failed to connect - May need different configuration
7. **vercel** ⚠ Needs authentication - Requires OAuth via `/mcp` command

### Skipped:
8. **everything** - Error during installation (module issue)

## Configuration Location

The MCP servers were added to your local Claude configuration at:
`~/.claude.json`

Note: These are user-scoped, not project-scoped. To make them project-scoped, we would need to add `--scope project` flag.

## Next Steps

### 1. Authenticate Vercel (if needed)
In Claude Code chat, run:
```
/mcp
```
Then complete the OAuth flow for Vercel.

### 2. Test Working Servers

**Sequential Thinking Test:**
Ask: "Use sequential thinking to create a 3-step plan for implementing provider profiles"

**Filesystem Test:**
Ask: "Using the filesystem MCP server, list all React components in the app directory"

**Memory Test:**
Ask: "Using the memory MCP server, remember that our marketplace is called 'Ecosystem' and the commission rate is 15%"

### 3. Fix Failed Servers (Optional)

The git, fetch, and time servers may need additional npm packages installed globally:
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch  
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-time
```

## Using MCP Servers with Agents

Now that MCP servers are set up, you can use them with Task agents. For example:

"Use the sequential thinking MCP server to plan the implementation of provider profiles, then use the filesystem server to create the necessary React components."

## Benefits

Even with just the 3 working servers, you now have:
- **Structured reasoning** for complex planning
- **Direct file access** for code generation
- **Context memory** for maintaining project knowledge across conversations

This foundation is sufficient to start building the Ecosystem marketplace with agent assistance!
