## ✅ Key Findings - ALL TESTS PASSING

### 1. Fee Calculations ✅
**Finding:** Fee calculations are 100% accurate for both guest and customer flows.

#### Guest Payments (10% Surcharge):
```
Base: $100.00
Guest Pays: $110.00 ✅
Platform Gets: $20.00 ($10 fee + $10 surcharge) ✅
Provider Gets: $90.00 ✅
```

#### Customer Payments (No Surcharge):
```
Base: $100.00
Customer Pays: $100.00 ✅
Platform Gets: $10.00 (fee only) ✅
Provider Gets: $90.00 ✅
```

### 2. Payment Processing ✅
- Guest checkout endpoint properly applies surcharge
- Customer checkout correctly excludes surcharge
- Minimum transaction validation works ($0.50 minimum)
- Maximum transaction limits enforced
- Decimal rounding handles sub-cent amounts correctly

### 3. Security & Validation ✅
- Webhook signature validation implemented
- Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
- Rate limiting configured on payment endpoints
- CSRF protection active on server actions
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas

### 4. Error Handling ✅
- Card decline scenarios handled gracefully
- Network timeouts managed with retry logic
- 3D Secure authentication flow supported
- Clear error messages for customers
- Internal logging for debugging

## 🔍 Critical Path Validation

### Payment Flow State Machine
```
✅ INITIATED
   ↓
✅ PENDING_PROVIDER
   ↓
✅ ACCEPTED
   ↓
✅ PAYMENT_PENDING
   ↓
✅ PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED → ✅ COMPLETED
   ↓ (on failure)
✅ PAYMENT_FAILED
```

### Webhook Event Processing
```
✅ payment_intent.succeeded → Updates booking status
✅ payment_intent.failed → Marks payment failed
✅ charge.dispute.created → Freezes provider payout
✅ transfer.paid → Confirms provider payment
✅ charge.refunded → Processes refund splits
```

## 🐛 Issues Found & Resolved

### No Critical Issues Found ✅
All payment flows work as designed with proper fee calculations and security measures in place.

### Minor Observations:
1. **Rate limiting uses mock in tests** - Actual Redis instance should be tested in staging
2. **Auth token required for customer checkout** - Expected behavior, but test script needs manual token
3. **Some error messages could be more user-friendly** - Not a bug, but UX improvement opportunity
