# ECOSYSTEM MARKETPLACE - MVP COMPLIANCE STRATEGY

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the minimum viable compliance approach for Ecosystem's two-sided marketplace MVP. Our strategy prioritizes platform liability protection while meeting basic regulatory requirements for launch. This conservative approach shifts responsibility to service providers where legally permissible while maintaining platform trust.

**Key Principles:**
- Platform acts as technology facilitator, not service guarantor
- Providers are independent contractors, not employees
- Conservative approach to liability and tax obligations
- Minimal viable compliance for rapid MVP deployment
- Clear boundaries of platform responsibility

---

## LEGAL FRAMEWORK & PLATFORM LIABILITY

### Platform Status Classification
**Ecosystem operates as a Technology Platform, NOT a Service Broker**

- We provide software tools connecting independent service providers with customers
- We do not employ service providers or control service delivery
- We facilitate transactions but do not guarantee service quality
- All services are contracted directly between providers and customers

### Liability Limitation Strategy

**Platform Limitations:**
- No warranties on service quality or provider reliability
- Limited liability for payment processing failures (covered by Stripe)
- No responsibility for service disputes beyond refund facilitation
- Force majeure protection for platform downtime
- Clear disclaimer of provider vetting beyond basic identity verification

**Provider Responsibility Transfer:**
- All service delivery obligations rest with providers
- Providers responsible for licensing, insurance, and regulatory compliance
- Providers handle all customer service issues directly
- Providers maintain their own cancellation and refund policies
- Tax compliance is provider responsibility

## TERMS OF SERVICE - KEY CLAUSES

### Tax Responsibility Clause (CRITICAL)
```
TAX OBLIGATIONS AND COMPLIANCE

Service providers acknowledge and agree that:

1. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS: Providers are independent contractors, 
   not employees of Ecosystem. Providers are solely responsible for 
   determining their tax obligations and compliance requirements.

2. TAX REPORTING: Providers are responsible for:
   - Reporting all income received through the platform
   - Paying all applicable federal, state, and local taxes
   - Obtaining required business licenses and permits
   - Maintaining appropriate business insurance

3. 1099 REPORTING: Ecosystem will issue Form 1099-K to providers who 
   receive $600 or more in gross payments in a calendar year, as 
   required by IRS regulations.

4. PLATFORM FEES: All platform fees are clearly disclosed. Providers 
   acknowledge that fees paid to Ecosystem are their business expense 
   and may be tax deductible (consult tax professional).

5. NO TAX ADVICE: Ecosystem does not provide tax or legal advice. 
   Providers should consult qualified professionals for compliance 
   guidance.
```

### Service Disclaimer Clause
```
SERVICE DELIVERY AND PLATFORM LIMITATIONS

1. FACILITATION ONLY: Ecosystem provides a technology platform 
   connecting service providers with customers. We do not provide 
   services directly nor guarantee service quality.

2. PROVIDER RESPONSIBILITY: All services are provided by independent 
   third parties. Ecosystem does not:
   - Employ or supervise service providers
   - Control service delivery methods or quality
   - Guarantee provider licensing or qualifications
   - Warrant service outcomes or customer satisfaction

3. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Primary disputes between customers and providers 
   should be resolved directly. Ecosystem may assist with refund 
   processing but is not obligated to resolve service quality issues.
```

## REFUND & DISPUTE POLICY

### Stripe Payment Link Strategy
Since MVP uses Stripe payment links rather than complex escrow:

**Refund Authority:**
- Platform retains refund authority for 48 hours post-booking
- After 48 hours, refunds require provider consent
- Emergency refunds (safety concerns) processed immediately
- All refunds processed through Stripe's standard mechanism

**Dispute Escalation:**
1. **Direct Resolution** (0-72 hours): Customer and provider resolve directly
2. **Platform Mediation** (72+ hours): Platform reviews evidence and makes binding decision
3. **Payment Dispute**: If unresolved, customer may pursue Stripe/bank chargeback
4. **Platform Fee Retention**: Platform fees are non-refundable except in cases of platform error

**Refund Categories:**
- **Full Refund:** Platform error, provider no-show, safety concerns
- **Partial Refund:** Service partially completed, mutual agreement
- **No Refund:** Customer no-show, completion within 24 hours of service start
- **Provider Discretion:** Service quality disputes beyond platform scope
