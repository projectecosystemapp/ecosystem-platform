- Color contrast ratios > 4.5:1
- Alternative text for images
- ARIA labels and descriptions

### **Implementation Examples**
```tsx
// Search interface with accessibility
<div role="search" aria-label="Provider search">
  <input 
    aria-describedby="search-hint"
    aria-autocomplete="list"
  />
  <div role="region" aria-live="polite">
    {/* Results */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🔄 User Workflows Designed

### **Search & Discovery Flow**
1. User enters search query and location
2. System returns filtered results with map view
3. User applies filters (price, rating, distance)
4. User selects provider and views profile
5. User initiates booking or saves provider

### **Homepage Discovery Flow**
1. User chooses Local or Global services
2. User browses by category or searches
3. System shows featured providers and trust signals
4. User discovers and evaluates providers
5. User proceeds to provider profile or booking

### **Account Management Flow**
1. User accesses account dashboard
2. User views upcoming bookings and stats
3. User manages saved providers and preferences
4. User handles booking changes and messages
5. User reviews completed services

### **Provider Verification Flow**
1. Provider accesses verification dashboard
2. Provider completes identity verification
3. Provider uploads insurance documentation
4. Provider submits professional licenses
5. System reviews and awards verification badges
