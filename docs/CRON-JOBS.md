# Cron Jobs & Automated Billing System

This document describes the automated billing and maintenance system for the marketplace platform. All cron jobs are configured to run automatically via Vercel Cron and include comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and alerting.

## üìã Overview

The system includes five main automated processes:

1. **Process Payouts** - Automated provider payouts via Stripe Connect
2. **Process Subscriptions** - Recurring subscription billing and management  
3. **Loyalty Maintenance** - Points expiration, tier updates, and benefits
4. **Pricing Analytics** - Demand analysis and surge pricing automation
5. **Payment Reconciliation** - Daily payment reconciliation and fraud detection

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Core Configuration

  cooldown: 4               // Hours before next surge
};
```

## üîç Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
```bash
GET /api/health/cron
```

Returns comprehensive health status for all cron jobs:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy|warning|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "checks": {
    "payouts": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "metrics": {
        "completed": 45,
        "failed": 2,
        "failureRate": "4.3%"
      }
    },
    "subscriptions": {
      "status": "healthy", 
      "metrics": {
        "active": 1250,
        "pastDue": 23,
        "pastDueRate": "1.8%"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Individual Service Health
```bash
POST /api/health/cron
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "service": "payouts|subscriptions|loyalty|pricing|reconciliation"
}
```

## üö® Error Handling & Alerting

### Slack Notifications
Automatic Slack alerts for:
- Cron job failures
- High failure rates (>10% for payouts, >5% past due for subscriptions)
- System anomalies

### Retry Strategies
- **Payouts**: 3 attempts with 1h, 4h, 24h delays
- **Subscriptions**: 3 attempts over 7 days  
- **Analytics**: No retries (non-critical)
- **Loyalty**: No retries (daily execution)

### Logging
All cron jobs log to console with structured data:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "job": "process-payouts",
  "duration": "1250ms",
  "processed": 45,
  "succeeded": 43,
  "failed": 2
}
```

## üîí Security

### Authentication
All cron endpoints require `CRON_SECRET` authentication:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret
```

### Rate Limiting
- Cron endpoints exempt from standard rate limits
- Internal rate limiting prevents abuse
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- PCI compliance for payment processing
- Audit logging for all financial transactions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Set up environment
export CRON_SECRET="test-secret"
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."

# Test individual endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-secret" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/process-payouts

# Test with dry-run mode
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-secret" \
  -H "X-Dry-Run: true" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/process-subscriptions
```

### Staging Validation
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run manual tests with test data
3. Verify Slack notifications work
4. Check health endpoints respond correctly
5. Validate database changes are correct

### Production Deployment
1. Update `CRON_SECRET` in production environment
2. Deploy via Vercel with cron configurations
3. Monitor first few executions closely
4. Verify all integrations work correctly
