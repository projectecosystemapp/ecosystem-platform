# Ecosystem Marketplace Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Ecosystem is a two-sided marketplace connecting service providers with customers, positioned as the "Airbnb for services." This roadmap defines three distinct phases with explicit scope boundaries and success metrics.

**Current State**: Basic infrastructure with auth (Clerk), database schemas, and provider profile components built but not wired to production-grade frontend.

**Target State**: Production-ready marketplace serving real traffic with provider profiles, booking system, and dashboards.

## Key Decisions

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 App Router for SEO and performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with row-level security ready schemas
- **Authentication**: Clerk (no change planned)
- **Payments**: Stripe (Links ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Tax progression)
- **Search**: PostgreSQL FTS ‚Üí Elasticsearch (Phase 2)
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel + Supabase (current) ‚Üí consider AWS/GCP at scale

### Business Model
- **Revenue**: 15% platform fee (configurable per provider)
- **Pricing**: Free for providers, commission-based
- **Growth**: SEO-driven acquisition, provider referrals
- **Moat**: Network effects, trust/reviews, payment convenience

### Risk Mitigations
- **Double-booking**: Pessimistic locking with holds

- **Fraud**: Stripe Radar + custom rules
- **Compliance**: ToS shifts liability to providers initially
- **Scale**: Database sharding plan at 10K providers
