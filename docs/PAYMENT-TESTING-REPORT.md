## 6. Critical Findings & Recommendations

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Fee calculations are accurate** - All test cases pass
2. **Webhook idempotency works** - No duplicate processing
3. **Security measures in place** - Signature validation, rate limiting
4. **Refund logic correct** - Proportional splits maintained

### ⚠️ Areas for Enhancement

#### 1. Missing Test Implementation
While test cases exist, the actual integration with live Stripe needs verification:
- Manual testing with Stripe CLI recommended
- Use test cards in staging environment
- Verify webhook delivery in production-like setup

#### 2. Rate Limiting Validation
- Current tests mock rate limiting
- Need load testing with actual Redis instance
- Recommend: 100 requests/minute for payment endpoints

#### 3. Error Message Consistency
- Some error messages expose internal details
- Standardize customer-facing error responses
- Log detailed errors internally only

#### 4. Monitoring & Alerting
**Recommended Metrics to Track:**
- Payment success rate (target: >98%)
- Average processing time (<2s)
- Webhook processing lag (<5s)
- Daily reconciliation discrepancies (<0.1%)

## 7. Test Execution Commands

### Run All Payment Tests
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/integration/payment-flows.test.ts
npm test -- __tests__/unit/webhook-idempotency.test.ts
npm test -- __tests__/integration/stripe-webhooks.test.ts
```

### Manual Testing with Stripe
```bash
# Start webhook forwarding
npm run stripe:listen

# Test successful payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/checkout/guest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "guestEmail": "test@example.com",
    "guestName": "Test User",
    "providerId": "uuid-here",
    "serviceId": "uuid-here",
    "bookingDate": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "startTime": "10:00",
    "endTime": "11:00"
  }'

# Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
# Use declined card: 4000 0000 0000 0002
```
