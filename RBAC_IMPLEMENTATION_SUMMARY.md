### 4. Security Features
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ‚úÖ Role-based access policies implemented
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for role switches
- ‚úÖ Helper functions with SECURITY DEFINER

### 5. Helper Functions
- `has_permission(user_id, resource, action)` - Check user permissions
- `switch_user_role(user_id, new_role)` - Switch active role with logging
- `assign_user_role(user_id, role, assigned_by)` - Assign roles to users

### 6. Database Optimizations
- Indexes on user_id, role fields for fast lookups
- Update triggers for timestamp management
- Efficient permission checking

## üöÄ Immediate Next Actions

1. **Payment Models Migration** (002_payment_architecture.sql)
   - Extend payment_models table with detailed configurations
   - Create payment_transactions table
   - Implement Stripe Connect integration

2. **Location Services Migration** (003_location_services.sql)
   - Add geographic data to providers
   - Implement service area management
   - Create location-based search

3. **Provider Profile Enhancement** (004_provider_enhancements.sql)
   - Add verification fields
   - Implement tier system
   - Create portfolio/gallery tables

## üìä Current System Status

- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Project ID**: mhyqvbeiqwkgfyqdfnlu
- **Tables Created**: 6 new RBAC tables + existing profile/provider tables
- **Total Permissions**: 50 role-based permissions
- **Security**: RLS enabled with policies
- **Functions**: 3 helper functions for role management

## üîí Security Considerations

1. All new tables have RLS enabled
2. Admin operations require admin role verification
3. Role switches are logged for audit trail
4. Service role key is properly configured
5. Permissions follow principle of least privilege

## üìù Notes for Development Team

- The `active_role` field on profiles determines current user permissions
- Users can have multiple roles but only one active at a time
- The `is_dual_role` flag helps identify users with provider + customer access
- Commission rates are configurable per category and can have tier-based overrides
- All timestamps use PostgreSQL NOW() for consistency
