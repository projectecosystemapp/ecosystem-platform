# Subscription Usage & Management System Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive subscription usage tracking and management system that integrates seamlessly with your existing marketplace booking system. This system provides real-time usage tracking, automatic application of subscription benefits, overage handling, and comprehensive admin tools.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### Database Schema Extensions

**New Tables Created:**

1. **`subscription_usage_records`** - Detailed audit trail of every usage event
   - Tracks individual service consumption
   - Records credits, adjustments, and refunds  
   - Links to bookings and tracks overage charges
   - Full audit trail with admin adjustments

2. **`subscription_usage_summaries`** - Aggregated period summaries
   - Period-based usage statistics
   - Remaining service allowances
   - Overage tracking and billing
   - Next reset dates

### API Endpoints Implemented

#### `/api/subscriptions/usage`
- **GET** - Get current usage statistics with optional history
- **POST** - Record service usage (automatic or manual)
- **PUT** - Admin usage adjustments (credits/deductions)
- **DELETE** - Reset usage counter (admin only)

#### `/api/subscriptions/bookings`  
- **GET** - Get bookings linked to subscriptions
- **POST** - Create booking with automatic subscription benefits
- **PUT** - Link existing booking to subscription
- **DELETE** - Unlink booking from subscription

### Service Layer

**`/lib/subscription-service.ts`** - Core business logic:
- `getActiveSubscription()` - Check customer subscription status
- `calculateSubscriptionPricing()` - Apply discounts and benefits
- `recordSubscriptionUsage()` - Track service consumption
- `checkSubscriptionEligibility()` - Verify usage allowances
- `resetSubscriptionPeriod()` - Handle billing cycle resets

**`/lib/subscription-webhooks.ts`** - Event handlers:
- `handleSubscriptionBookingCompletion()` - Record usage on completion
- `handleSubscriptionRenewal()` - Reset usage counters
- `handleSubscriptionCancellation()` - Mark subscription inactive
- `handleSubscriptionPause/Resume()` - Pause/resume functionality

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Automatic Booking Integration

Enhanced the existing `createBookingAction()` in `/actions/bookings-actions.ts`:
- Automatically checks for active subscriptions
- Applies discounts and benefits
- Records usage for included services
- Handles overage scenarios
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Fee Calculation System

Integrates with existing `calculateFees()` function:
- Respects subscription pricing adjustments
- Handles $0 bookings for included services
- Calculates platform fees on discounted amounts
- Manages overage billing through Stripe

### Database Integration

Updated `/db/db.ts` schema exports:
- Added all new subscription usage tables
- Maintains existing relationships
- Supports transaction-based operations

## üìä Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Automatic tracking when services are used
await recordSubscriptionUsage(subscriptionId, bookingId, description);
```

### 2. Automatic Benefit Application
```typescript
// Checks subscription eligibility and applies benefits automatically
const booking = await createBookingAction({
  ...bookingData,
  applySubscriptionBenefits: true // Default behavior
});
```

### 3. Overage Handling
```typescript
// Configurable overage rates and automatic billing
const subscription = {
  benefits: {
    allowOverage: true,
    overageRateCents: 2500 // $25 per overage service
  }
};
```

### 4. Admin Management Tools
```typescript
// Credit services to customer accounts
await fetch('/api/subscriptions/usage', {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    subscriptionId: 'sub-123',
    quantity: 3, // Add 3 service credits
    reason: 'Customer service credit'
  })
});
```

### 5. Comprehensive Analytics
- Usage history with filtering
- Period-based summaries
- Overage tracking and billing
- Next reset date calculations
- Upcoming booking previews

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require Clerk authentication
- Customer-level access control (users see only their data)
- Provider access to their subscription customers
- Admin-only functions for usage adjustments

### Rate Limiting
- Usage recording: 60 requests/minute
- Usage queries: 100 requests/minute  
- Admin adjustments: 30 requests/minute

### Data Validation
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all inputs
- UUID validation for all IDs
- Business rule validation (e.g., overage limits)

## üí∞ Business Logic Implementation

### Fee Structure Integration
- **Platform Fee**: 10% base commission on all transactions
- **Guest Surcharge**: Additional 10% for non-authenticated users
- **Subscription Benefits**: Applied before fee calculation
- **Overage Billing**: Configurable per-service rates

### Usage Calculation Rules
```typescript
const usageRules = {
  includedServices: plan.servicesPerCycle,
  bonusServices: adminCredits,
  totalAllowance: includedServices + bonusServices,
  overageAllowed: plan.benefits?.allowOverage ?? false,
  overageRate: plan.benefits?.overageRateCents ?? 0
};
```

### State Management
Follows your existing booking state machine:
- INITIATED ‚Üí PENDING_PROVIDER ‚Üí ACCEPTED ‚Üí PAYMENT_PENDING ‚Üí PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED ‚Üí COMPLETED
- Usage recorded on COMPLETED status
- Reversible if booking canceled before completion

## üìù API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation created in `/docs/API-SUBSCRIPTION-USAGE.md` including:
- Complete endpoint reference
- Request/response examples
- Error handling patterns
- Usage patterns and best practices
- Integration examples
- Testing scenarios

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Endpoint
- `/api/subscriptions/usage/test` - Verify system is working

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. **Normal Usage Flow**
   - Customer has active subscription with 5 services/month
   - Creates 3 bookings (free/discounted)
   - Usage properly tracked and remaining services calculated

2. **Overage Handling**
   - Customer exceeds monthly allowance
   - Overage charges calculated and billed
   - Usage continues to track properly

3. **Admin Management**
   - Add/remove service credits
   - Reset usage counters
   - Historical reporting and analytics

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Subscription cancellation mid-period
   - Booking cancellation with usage reversal
   - Multiple subscriptions per customer

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Database Migrations Required
Run the following to create new tables:
```bash
npm run db:generate  # Generate migration files
npm run db:migrate   # Apply to database
```

### Environment Considerations
- Works with existing Stripe Connect integration
- Requires Redis for rate limiting (already configured)
- Uses existing authentication system (Clerk)

### Monitoring & Observability
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Usage metrics for business analytics
- Performance monitoring hooks

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Database Efficiency
- Indexed foreign key relationships
- Partial selects to reduce data transfer
- Prepared statements for repeated queries
- Transaction-based operations for consistency

### Caching Strategy
- Rate limiting via Upstash Redis
- Query result caching for usage summaries
- Subscription eligibility caching per request

### API Design
- Pagination for large result sets
- Optional data inclusion (e.g., history)
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The system is designed to support future features:

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Customer usage patterns
   - Provider subscription metrics
   - Predictive overage alerts
   - Churn analysis

2. **Flexible Benefits**
   - Time-based restrictions
   - Service-type limitations  
   - Geographic restrictions
   - Priority booking windows

3. **Multi-tier Subscriptions**
   - Different service allowances
   - Tiered pricing models
   - Upgrade/downgrade flows

4. **Automated Billing**
